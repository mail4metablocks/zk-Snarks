# zk-Snarks

zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) is a type of zero-knowledge proof that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information about the statement itself.

zk-SNARKs are used in a variety of applications, including privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies such as Zcash, and secure multi-party computation protocols. They are particularly useful in situations where it is important to verify the authenticity of a statement without revealing any sensitive information about the statement itself.

In a zk-SNARK proof, the prover generates a proof that a statement is true, and the verifier can check the validity of the proof without needing to know the specifics of the statement. The proof consists of a small amount of data (called a "proof") that can be easily verified by the verifier, but is infeasible to generate without knowing the specifics of the statement. This allows the prover to prove the authenticity of a statement without revealing any sensitive information about the statement.

zk-SNARKs are based on a branch of mathematics called elliptic curve cryptography, and they rely on advanced mathematical concepts such as polynomial commitments and homomorphic hashes. Despite their complexity, zk-SNARKs have gained widespread adoption due to their efficiency and versatility.
