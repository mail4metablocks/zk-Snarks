# zk-Snarks

zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) is a type of zero-knowledge proof that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information about the statement itself.

zk-SNARKs are used in a variety of applications, including privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies such as Zcash, and secure multi-party computation protocols. They are particularly useful in situations where it is important to verify the authenticity of a statement without revealing any sensitive information about the statement itself.

In a zk-SNARK proof, the prover generates a proof that a statement is true, and the verifier can check the validity of the proof without needing to know the specifics of the statement. The proof consists of a small amount of data (called a "proof") that can be easily verified by the verifier, but is infeasible to generate without knowing the specifics of the statement. This allows the prover to prove the authenticity of a statement without revealing any sensitive information about the statement.

zk-SNARKs are based on a branch of mathematics called elliptic curve cryptography, and they rely on advanced mathematical concepts such as polynomial commitments and homomorphic hashes. Despite their complexity, zk-SNARKs have gained widespread adoption due to their efficiency and versatility.

## zk-Snarks libraries in Rust

There are several popular libraries for implementing zk-SNARKs in the Rust programming language. Some of the most well-known libraries include:

bellman: This library provides a Rust implementation of the Bellman zk-SNARK library, which is a high-performance library for generating and verifying zk-SNARK proofs.

snarky: This library is a Rust implementation of the libsnark library, which is a C++ library for generating and verifying zk-SNARK proofs. snarky provides a Rust-friendly interface to libsnark and is designed to be easy to use.

jubjub: This library is a Rust implementation of the jubjub curve, which is a curve used in the construction of zk-SNARKs. It provides efficient algorithms for working with jubjub points and scalars, and is used by other libraries as a building block for implementing zk-SNARKs.

zokrates: This is a toolkit for implementing zk-SNARKs and other zero-knowledge protocols in the Rust programming language. It provides a high-level interface for working with zk-SNARKs and makes it easy to write custom zero-knowledge proofs.

These are just a few examples of the libraries available for implementing zk-SNARKs in Rust. There are many other options available, and the choice of library will depend on the specific needs and requirements of your application.
